# Maze Solving Robot

Maze solving robot using an Arduino and Line Sensing Array (IR)

This project is developed based on the IIT Bombay problem statement "Meshmerise" where the following components are used:
- Arduino Uno / Nano
- Line Sensing Array (Tested two types - LSA08 and RSL)
- L298N Motor Driver (Alternative - Cytron Motor Driver)
- N20 Motors 600RPM (Due to their compact size and speed)
- Breadboard
- Jumper Cables
- LED

For a more compact and fast robot, designing your own PCB is recommended as we did!
